# Claude Code Agent Analysis

## Agent System Overview
This document tracks the analysis of Claude Code's agent system and architecture. Claude Code appears to implement a sophisticated multi-agent system for handling various development tasks.

## Analysis Goals
- Understand the agent system architecture design
- Map agent communication patterns and workflows
- Document the agent lifecycle and state management

## Preliminary Observations
*This section will be populated as analysis progresses*

## Agent Types
*To be identified through static and dynamic analysis*

## Communication Patterns
*To be documented based on runtime analysis*

## Architecture Insights
*Key findings about the agent system design*

## Analysis Methodology
1. **Static Code Analysis**: Search for agent-related patterns in `cli.js`
2. **Dynamic Tracing**: Monitor agent instantiation and communication during runtime
3. **API Analysis**: Track requests and responses related to agent operations
4. **Behavioral Analysis**: Document observable agent behaviors and decision-making

## Tools and Techniques
- JavaScript deobfuscation tools
- Runtime monkey patching
- Network request interception
- Code pattern analysis
- Execution flow tracing

## Notes
- Agent system likely uses event-driven architecture
- May implement different agent types for specialized tasks (code generation, analysis, debugging, etc.)
- Communication possibly handled through message passing or shared state
- Integration with external APIs (likely Claude API) for LLM capabilities
